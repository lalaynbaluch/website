But the young actor only discovered his passion for the stage after undertaking training at the <a href="http://www.rcs.ac.uk/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.rcs.ac.uk/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama</a>. He will now appear in his first major production since graduating last summer – playing Romeo in <a href="http://www.headlongtheatre.co.uk/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.headlongtheatre.co.uk/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Headlong Theatre’s</a> production of Romeo and Juliet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about your first high-profile project?</strong></p>
<p>It’s completely exciting. <a href="http://unitedagents.co.uk/robert-icke" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/unitedagents.co.uk/robert-icke?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Rob</a> [Icke, the director] doesn’t feel like he’s seen a good enough Romeo and Juliet and has been disappointed with various productions. You feel a freshness with his approach. I had four auditions with different Juliets and I got really excited about what I was going to do, and making relatively brave decisions. But the second you get it, you think ‘oh no, I have to do it now’. There was a moment of apprehensiveness, but because the atmosphere in rehearsals has been brilliant that has gradually eroded.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges of Shakespeare?</strong></p>
<p>Rob wants to get away from that very grand way of doing Shakespeare. I think that can be quite distancing for the audience if you bellow like a French horn. I think the reason I was cast is that he is a fan of the naturalistic way of saying the lines. It is exciting when you see a play and think ‘I totally get it now’, rather than ‘you said that beautifully and rhythmically’ – I don’t think that turns people on.</p>
<p><strong>Is training important?</strong></p>
<p>Now that I’ve trained I can’t imagine what it wouldn’t be like. I had originally applied to drama school because I was a fan of film acting but I had the amazing privilege of falling in love with theatre while I was there – I owe drama school that. I think it also stops you being scared of stuff and changes your perceptions of what a good actor is.</p>
<p><strong>Was your dad an influence on your career choice?</strong></p>
<p>Not really, he just let me get on with it, in the loveliest way. Obviously like he is an inspiring dad, and obviously every boy or girl wants to make their parents proud. He is interested, and helpful and supportive but no more than I think he would be with anything. I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Would you work with him?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always said that I would never want to be at the RSC while he was there. I would feel strange – I wouldn’t want other people to think it was nepotism, even though I’m sure that wouldn’t be the case. I’d love to work with him at the stage when, and I hope this happens, but who knows, I was established enough that it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>How do you unwind?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve got the same bunch of friends in London that I’ve had since I was 11. I like watching football and listening to music. Staying in touch with that keeps you saner.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Interview with playwright and screenwriter Lucinda Coxon about her show Herding Cats]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='../wp-content/plugins/simple-post-thumbnails/timthumb6f14.png?src=/wp-content/thumbnails/357.jpg&amp;w=200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;ft=jpg' alt='post thumbnail' /></p>
<p>Published in <a href="http://www.thestage.co.uk/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.thestage.co.uk?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">The Stage</a>, December &#8217;11</p>
<p><strong><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Lucinda-Coxon-copy.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-358" title="Lucinda-Coxon-copy" src="../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Lucinda-Coxon-copy-231x300.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Lucinda-Coxon-copy-231x300.jpg 231w, http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Lucinda-Coxon-copy.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a>Pantomimes are a staple of British life during the festive season &#8211; but alternative Christmas shows are becoming an increasingly popular option for those who want to break with tradition. Lalayn Baluch talks to Lucinda Coxon, the creative force behind one such offer, Herding Cats.</strong></p>
<p>Each year as December approaches theatres start dusting off glass carriages for Cinderella, planting beanstalks for Jack and promoting the household name lined up to play Widow Twanky. The activities surrounding pantomimes are as much a festive ritual as putting up a Christmas tree or switching on fairy lights and are important not just because the shows are a British tradition, but because they are the most lucrative events that most venues will stage – a theatrical sure thing we can say.</p>
<p>However, for those without children, or just not that way inclined, alternative Christmas shows are becoming an increasingly popular option. Take dark comedy Herding Cats, which will receive its London premiere at the <a href="http://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.hampsteadtheatre.com/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Hampstead Theatre</a>, as an example. A three hander featuring a highly strung office worker, a telephone sex line operator and a caller with sadistic fantasies, it is certainly not for the whole family. Yet the show enjoyed a successful run at the <a href="http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/page/3029/Ustinov+Studio" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.theatreroyal.org.uk/page/3029/Ustinov+Studio?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Ustinov</a> in Bath last Christmas and recently picked up a nomination in the Best New Play category at the 2011 Theatre Awards UK.</p>
<p>So what do we call this kind of show? “It’s a pantidote,” says playwright <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucinda_Coxon" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucinda_Coxon?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Lucinda Coxon</a>, the creative force behind the play. “It is set in the run up to Christmas, and the aftermath, so it partly incorporates the high hopes and the deluded optimism of the season.</p>
<p>“At the centre is a character called Justine who is a young woman working hard in one of those jobs that people are dying to get hold of. But it’s not very satisfying with very long hours. When you haven’t got anyone to come home to what happens next?”</p>
<p>It’s a situation that many viewers will be able to connect with, as they perhaps will with the play’s other line of enquiry – the effects of developing technology on the way people interact with each other. This was not, however, a theme that Coxon specifically sought to look at. “I think I am rarely inspired by a subject. I mean that is what the play came to be about. Plays generally arrive through talking and it tends to be an organic process,” she explains.</p>
<p>This will most likely explain why the writer, who lives in north-west London with her 12-year-old daughter, prefers not to pen shows under commission and instead treads a trickier course by writing shows before pitching them to theatres.</p>
<p>“I feel as though it is a bit like having a baby and knowing that you will be giving it up for adoption,” says Coxon about writing under commission. “It puts you off. I find it a bit demotivating – I just need to have ownership.</p>
<p>“Writing for the <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">National Theatre</a> is slightly different. It is relatively pleasant experience because it binds you into a very big organisation and there are lots of different spaces there. There isn’t a sense that everything is predetermined. I think often now there is a lot of pressure on writers to take a commission and say what the play will be that they are going to deliver. I think it is disgraceful that one is asked that. You’d have to lie. I mean how do you know?</p>
<p>“There is such a tiny amount of money involved – theatre commissions are generally quite poorly paid – so the idea that you are required to do that is cheeky.”</p>
<p>With that said, Coxon does take into consideration the practicalities of staging a show during the writing process. Herding Cats was penned with the Ustinov in mind and created as a three-hander so that it would be easy to “whack on”. She chose <a href="http://anthony-banks.co.uk/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/anthony-banks.co.uk/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Anthony Banks</a>, who she had worked with at the NT, to direct the show and says it was “absolutely critical” to select her own director.</p>
<p>“You need to know that it is someone you are in tune with. I have been directed by people whose work I hadn’t seen before when I have worked abroad. The results are sometimes disastrous. The last director I worked with on stage with Thea Sharrock – I knew Thea’s work very well and was thrilled to be working with her. Generally it is crucial; you have to fall in love with your director,” she says.</p>
<p>As Coxon’s earlier comment on commissions indicates, she has a special relationship with the NT. The playwright believes a recent career break was when the London venue staged her show Happy Now? – it helped to mark her return to the UK after mainly working in the US for almost a decade. And it is a relationship that appears to be bearing fruit, as Coxon reveals that she has just submitted a play to the theatre about Vermeer forgerer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_van_Meegeren" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_van_Meegeren?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Hans van Megreen</a>. But we will have to watch this space for further details.</p>
<p>Coxon is also a successful screenwriter. Her film work includes <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301390/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.imdb.com/title/tt0301390/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">The Heart of Me</a> starring Helena Bonham Carter and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810819/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.imdb.com/title/tt0810819/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">The Danish Girl</a>, which will be released next year starring Nicole Kidman and directed by Tomas Alfredson of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy fame. Her first television project – an adaptation of Michel Faber’s book <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zxc4d" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zxc4d?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">The Crimson Petal and the White</a> – aired in April and there are plans for her to join forces with the same BBC creative team next year.</p>
<p>When asked about subsidy cuts in the arts, she reveals that she experienced the effects of cuts more in film than theatre. However, she laments over the struggles of Derby Playhouse (it was the venue in her hometown that sparked her love of performing arts) and raises concerns about the impact of cuts in the regions. She says: “Now I am older I can travel around London and cherry pick things, but if you are 15 in Derby it [local venues] really matter. It would be the provinces I would be really worried about.”</p>
<p>Coxon began writing theatre in 1984 after reading English Literature at Oxford University. She moved to London to work on a show at the Finborough and then found herself doing “crazy London jobs” – working in a handbag shop and selling advertising – before establishing a relationship with the Bush Theatre. She describes the move to the capital as “thrilling”.</p>
<p>So why did she decide to work in California’s <a href="http://www.scr.org/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.scr.org/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">South Coast Rep Theatre</a> for most of the nineties and noughties? A few years ago during a newspaper interview Coxon blamed London’s “blokey” theatre scene for offering limited opportunities to female playwrights. Now, while she concedes that this problem persists, her reasons are different.</p>
<p>“It is an amazing theatre where they commission a lot of work and where they commission the same writers over and over. It meant you can make a living in theatre,” she says. “There are very few places like that here [in London].”</p>
<p>Coxon’s optimism regarding female playwrights is also growing and after watching <a href="http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/the-village-bike" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/the-village-bike?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">The Village Bike</a> at the Royal Court she cites <a href="http://unitedagents.co.uk/penelope-skinner" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/unitedagents.co.uk/penelope-skinner?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Penelope Skinner</a> as writer to watch out for. “I was so incredibly excited by it that I wrote her a fan letter,” she reveals.</p>
<p>“The trouble is when one talks about the issue [of opportunities for women] one also has to bear in mind that male playwrights also fall out of fashion. Playwrights are at the mercy of fashion in a way that other writers aren’t. There is an obsession with developing new writers rather than growing mature writers. There is a fantastic generation of younger female playwrights, and they might have longer legs than the ones that went before.”</p>

<p>Published in The Stage, November &#8217;11</p>
<p><strong><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Michael-Beckley-sized.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-347" title="Michael-Beckley-sized" src="../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Michael-Beckley-sized-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Michael-Beckley-sized-300x300.jpg 300w, http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Michael-Beckley-sized-150x150.jpg 150w, http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Michael-Beckley-sized-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Like many of Australia’s best loved acting exports, including Cate Blanchett and Mel Gibson, Michael Beckley trained at Sydney’s National Institute of Dramatic Art, before becoming a stage and screen performer. Best known for playing Rhys Sutherland in Home and Away, the actor moved to the UK six years ago to try his luck on the English stage and stayed ever since.  This month he will play Bradley in Pulitzer prize-winning thriller Buried Child.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Buried Child about?</strong></p>
<p>It is set in the American mid-west in a broken down farmhouse, in the boondocks. There is an elderly man sitting on a couch coughing away, watching television, sneaking drinks and talking to his wife. Bit by bit more layers are removed, you realise this is not a functional family. There’s quite a metaphysical aspect to it because you realise that this isn’t reality as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Bradley like?</strong></p>
<p>Bradley, we believe, is the middle son. The fact that we aren’t sure tells you what kind of play it is. He lost half a leg in a chainsaw accident at some point. Was it self-inflicted? What effect has it had on him? We think he used to be a nice guy. But he is clearly a rather dark, malevolent character.</p>
<p><strong>How will you portray an amputee?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a device which will clamp to my leg to make it look artificial. I’m going to have to learn how to move with that and give that impression. I hope I’m not giving too much away.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you move to the UK?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to scare the hell out of myself. I was very comfortable in Australia; I had worked in many places, was fairly well ensconced there and had a great agent. I thought ‘I want to go up another level and improve my skills.  I’ll go to England where nobody knows me, where I have to start from scratch’. For the first two months I could barely get my foot in the door, then I had this marvellous week when I got an agent and a part in A Few Good Men on the West End.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to do more West End shows?</strong></p>
<p>I’d love it. The West End and Broadway are the goals that tell you that you are doing ok – if that doesn’t sounds too arrogant. You think ‘if I am working in the West End I can’t be too crap at this’.</p>
<p><strong>Is formal training necessary?</strong></p>
<p>I think it depends actor to actor – I thrived on it. I did my training more than 20 years ago and I still used things I learnt from it in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest [at Leicester Curve]. There are some actors like Toni Collette, who I worked with when she was 17. We all knew there was something special about her. She went to NIDA but dropped out because it didn’t suit her, but she is great, so natural and confident in what she does.</p>
<p><em>Buried Child runs at Leicester Curve from November 11-December 3</em></p>

<p><strong>What are you enjoying most about the comedy?</strong></p>
<p>JD: The perception of the way we behave is so wittily observed. Noel Coward really understood the games that people play. His script is just delicious.</p>
<p>RW: It is written simply, beautifully succinct and perfectly phrased. It is also such a modern play with social commentary, almost by accident, about people’s unrealistic expectations of happiness. That’s a pertinent theme in modern culture.</p>
<p><strong>What is it like acting alongside your spouse?</strong></p>
<p>JD: It gives us a chance to play together, instead of just going home and doing the dishes. There are advantages – snuggling up on a sofa is easy, there is no frisson. The disadvantages are that I work differently. I don’t learn my lines until I understand why I am saying them. He learns his lines very easily.</p>
<p>RW: It has its moments. We’ve left our children in London and we are with each other 24 hours playing a couple who are constantly bickering. But it is wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Do you rehearse together at home?</strong></p>
<p>JD: We’ve gone through lines while cooking supper. We would often do that at home – I would say can you look at my lines, while stirring the pasta.</p>
<p>RW: We do rattle off lines together but we have to resist the temptation to not only do that.</p>
<p><strong>What sparked your love of theatre?</strong></p>
<p>JD: Many things. Hearing Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. Seeing a neighbour do an amateur production of the Taming of the Shrew. At home it was hard at times and turning myself into somebody else was an escape. Also my mum and dad loved the theatre. They would take us to London and we would watch shows from up in the gods.</p>
<p>RW: My grandmother was an actress, and my parents and sister. I did a degree in History and German before drama school, so I was in my mid-twenties by the time I started in the business. This was from seeing what the lifestyle was like and thinking ‘is there something else I can do’? I think it is something that people have genetically in them.</p>
<p><strong>How do you unwind?</strong></p>
<p>JD: I like wild swimming. I like being with my children, Matilda and Alfie, they are very bright and interesting people. I like having reflexology because it is a great way of relaxing.</p>
<p>RW: My daughter is getting very good at dinghy sailing and I love to do that with her. My son has just started playing golf which is great – he will be better than me in five years. I like swimming; I’m a member of the Serpentine Club.</p>

<p><strong><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sebastien_Torkia1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-354" title="Sebastien_Torkia" src="../wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sebastien_Torkia1-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300" srcset="http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sebastien_Torkia1-236x300.jpg 236w, http://lalaynbaluch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sebastien_Torkia1.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></a>From Grease and La Cage Aux Folles to Guys and Dolls, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868088/" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.imdb.com/name/nm0868088/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">Sebastien Torkia</a> is accustomed to appearing in west end musical hits as an actor, singer and dancer. But his latest role involves a whole new challenge – donning a full body costume-cum-puppet to play crazed hyena Ed in theatreland favourite <a href="http://www.disney.co.uk/musicaltheatre/TheLionKing/home/index.jsp" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('../outgoing/www.disney.co.uk/musicaltheatre/TheLionKing/home/index4fe7.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Flalaynbaluch.co.uk%2F');">The Lion King</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you prepare for the role?</strong></p>
<p>Moving hyena-like on all fours is obviously a lot of physical work, and so is holding two front legs of the puppet and using them to walk on. During rehearsals I spent hours exploring all the possibilities. Because it is a comedic role, the more you can do with the puppet, the more interesting it is – scratching a part of the body with the front leg, or sneezing and spitting with the mask. All little things to make Ed come alive.</p>
<p><strong>Is it difficult performing in a costume?</strong></p>
<p>The costume is like a big overall – a duvet we call it. I am used to doing high energy work as a dancer, so it doesn’t bother me. I don’t tend to think about the bulk of the costumes – they are so well designed and they follow your body. But you need to be in shape and if you are not, doing the show eight times a week will certainly knock you into shape.</p>
<p><strong>What was the audition process?</strong></p>
<p>I had five auditions. The first audition I had to sing and read scenes from The Lion King. It got more intense with each recall and the final audition was with the worldwide creative team –by that point you’re not just acting and singing but working with the puppet to see if you have dexterity and coordination to make it come alive. It adds to the pressure because you’re not that familiar with the puppets and I am not a puppeteer. Maybe at the end of my time at the Lion King I’ll be able to call myself a puppeteer.</p>
<p><strong>Is formal training important?</strong></p>
<p>It is very important. It gives you a good grounding in being able to sustain a career. Training [at the London Studio Theatre] has taught me discipline and respect for the profession – you can get that if you don’t have training but you have to learn it on your own and it can be tough. It’s important to be disciplined because there will be periods when you’re out of work and you have to maintain your skills and be ready to pull it out of the bag. I could get a call at 5 o’clock and have to audition the next day – your muscles, vocal and body, have to be prepared to produce the goods.</p>
<p><strong>What is your dream role?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many. It’s always great fun playing a baddie, and I understudy Scar in The Lion King. It is fun because it is the opposite of you, and you can get away with so much and live your fantasies as the bad guy.</p>
